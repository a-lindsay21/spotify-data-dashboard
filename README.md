## 🙋‍♀️ Why Use Fake Data?

This project was built as part of a personal coding challenge. Real Spotify data is not publicly available in large, raw CSV form without scraping or using their API — so a synthetic dataset was created to simulate realistic patterns while avoiding copyright or privacy issues.
But it was still fun!
